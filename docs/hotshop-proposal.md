# Introduction
How many times have you walked aimlessly through a grocery store trying to remember what was on your shopping list, only to buy several things you didn’t need? This all-in-one app simplifies the process of keeping track of your groceries at home and splits expenses in a fair and efficient way. HotShop is an easy shopping app that can be used by the whole household to ensure that you never forget your groceries again.
To begin, users of HotShop will have to register an account. From there, they have options to join or create new groups/households. These groups are used to link shopping lists between all users of the same group. Groups can then determine someone to shop for all selected items on the shopping list. Shopping list items are labeled with the users that will be using the product. That way, the cost of the product is only split between those who actually use it. As the shopper is shopping, they will be able to mark off items and specify the prices of each. When the shopping is complete, the price of the shopping list will be split fairly between all users.
	
# Anticipated Technologies
* Android Studio IDE for App Development
* Cloud-based Database. (MySQL? Azure?)
* Git for version control 
* Jira for Project Management
* Java libraries for application development

# Method/Approach
We plan to create a backlog of tasks on Jira for all of the features and subtasks necessary to complete each task. We will then hold weekly scrums to pull in tasks into a 1 week or 2 week long sprint. Each team member will be assigned specific tasks and keep the Jira project updated with progress. At each scrum progress will be evaluated and new goals will be set.

# Estimated Timeline
* Login/Registering New Users (Sprint 1 - 1 Week)
* Backend- Database Connection (Sprint 2 - 1 Week)
	* Be able to register and login multiple unique users.
	* Be able to create and store households/user groups to ensure that shopping lists are linked between unique users.
* Frontend- Create application user-interface (Sprint 3 - 1 week)
	* Create an application icon.
	* Follow a theme for login screen.
	* Determine aesthetic aspects of the application.
__Midterm Deliverables 10/28 - 10/30__
* Grocery Item Object (Sprint 4 - 1 Week)
	* Create an object that can store specific details about a grocery item being purchased.
* Creating Lists (Sprint 5 - 1 Week)
	* Ensure that the shopping list object can be edited by users of the same group and is displayed in a user-friendly style.
* Cost Splitting (Sprint 6 - 1 Week)
	* Total cost of products purchased on the shopping list can be split between the users of the product. Users can consist of those in the group that are actually using the product.
* Testing (Sprint 7 - 2 weeks)
	* Perform unit testing.
	* Perform integration testing.
__Final Deliverables 12/07 - 12/11__

# Anticipated Problems
* Database connectivity and security.
	* As the project develops, the database may need to be edited to ensure the data stored is stored properly, efficiently, and safely in the case of user ID’s and passwords.
	* If project functionality is added, the database may need to be updated to store new information.
* Android Studio Development
	* Most group members have little to no experience with Android Studio, so learning the IDE may take a small amount of time.
* Unit/Integration Testing
	* If unit testing and integration testing goes bad, we may need to rework large portions of the application. However, this is less of a risk because testing will be done throughout.
